This project will shown a 'mininet-wifi' code that will use for create a "Moving Wireless Object" Simulation.
The main purpose of this GitHub is used for completed task on subject "Rekayasa Wireless Network" to create an application about Mininet-Wifi.

The "sta1" simulated as a wireless object that moving with random direction. When the object in the coverage "Access Point" area, it will get connectivity.
